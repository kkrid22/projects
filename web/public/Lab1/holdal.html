                <p class="altalanos">Fully grown giraffes stand 4.3-5.7 m (14-19 ft) tall, with males taller than
                    females. The average weight
                    is 1,192 kg (2,628 lb) for an adult male and 828 kg (1,825 lb) for an adult female.
                    Despite its long neck and legs, its body is relatively short. The skin is mostly gray, or tan, and
                    can
                    reach a thickness of 20 mm (0.79 in). The 80-100 cm (31-39 in) long tail ends in a
                    long, dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.

                    The coat has dark blotches or patches, which can be orange, chestnut, brown, or nearly black,
                    surrounded
                    by light hair, usually white or cream coloured. Male giraffes become darker
                    as they grow old. The coat pattern has been claimed to serve as camouflage in the light and shade
                    patterns of savannah woodlands. When standing among trees and bushes, they are hard to see
                    at even a few metres distance. However, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an
                    approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves rather than on
                    camouflage, which may be more important for calves. Each giraffe has a unique coat pattern. Calves
                    inherit some coat pattern traits from their mothers, and variation in some spot traits
                    is correlated with calf survival. The skin under the blotches may regulate the animal's body
                    temperature, being sites for complex blood vessel systems and large sweat glands.

                    The fur may give the animal chemical defense, as its parasite repellents give it a characteristic
                    scent.
                    At least 11 main aromatic chemicals are in the fur, although indole and
                    3-methylindole are responsible for most of the smell. Because males have a stronger odour than
                    females,
                    it may also have a sexual function.</p>

                <h3>giraffe's biology</h3>
                <p class="altalanos"> The giraffe's circulatory system has several adaptations to compensate for its
                    great height. Its 11
                    kg
                    (25 lb) and 60 cm (2 ft) heart must generate approximately double the blood pressure
                    required for a human to maintain blood flow to the brain. As such, the wall of the heart can be as
                    thick
                    as 7.5 cm (3.0 in). Giraffes have relatively high heart rates for their size,
                    at 150 beats per minute. When the animal lowers its head, the blood rushes down fairly unopposed and
                    a
                    rete mirabile in the upper neck, with its large cross-sectional area, prevents excess
                    blood flow to the brain. When it raises again, the blood vessels constrict and push blood into the
                    brain
                    so the animal does not faint. The jugular veins contain several (most commonly seven)
                    valves to prevent blood flowing back into the head from the inferior vena cava and right atrium
                    while
                    the head is lowered. Conversely, the blood vessels in the lower legs are under
                    great pressure because of the weight of fluid pressing down on them. To solve this problem, the skin
                    of
                    the lower legs is thick and tight, preventing too much blood from pouring into them.</p>

                <h3>Domestication</h3>
                <p class="altalanos">The earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated dog were
                    discovered in
                    Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany. Contextual, isotopic, genetic, and morphological evidence shows that this
                    dog
                    was not a local wolf. The dog was dated to 14,223 years ago and was found buried along with a man
                    and a woman, all three having been sprayed with red hematite powder and buried under large, thick
                    basalt
                    blocks. The dog had died of canine distemper. Earlier remains dating back to 30,000 years ago have
                    been described as Paleolithic dogs, but their status as dogs or wolves remains debated because
                    considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves during the Late Pleistocene.

                    This timing indicates that the dog was the first species to be domesticated in the time of
                    hunter-gatherers, which predates agriculture. DNA sequences show that all ancient and modern dogs
                    share a common ancestry and descended from an ancient, extinct wolf population which was distinct
                    from
                    the modern wolf lineage.</p>

                <h3>Intelligence</h3>

                <p class="altalanos">Researchers have tested dogs' ability to perceive information, retain it as
                    knowledge, and apply it
                    to
                    solve problems. Studies of two dogs suggest that dogs can learn by inference and have advanced
                    memory
                    skills. A study with Rico, a Border Collie, showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different
                    items.
                    He inferred the names of novel things by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those new items
                    immediately and four weeks after the initial exposure. A study of another Border Collie, Chaser,
                    documented his learning and memory capabilities. He had learned the names and could associate by
                    verbal
                    command over 1,000 words. Dogs can read and react appropriately to human body language such as
                    gesturing, pointing, and human voice commands.

                    One study of canine cognitive abilities found that dogs' capabilities are no more exceptional than
                    those
                    of other animals, such as horses, chimpanzees, or cats. One limited study of 18 household dogs found
                    that they lacked spatial memory, and were more focused on the "what" of a task rather than the
                    "where".

                    Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception. An experimental study showed compelling
                    evidence that Australian dingos can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving,
                    indicating
                    that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem-solving abilities once they joined
                    humans. Another study revealed that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task,
                    dogs faced with an unsolvable version of the same problem look at the human, while socialized wolves
                    do
                    not.</p>

                <img src="pic/racoon.jpg" alt="raccoon">
                <h3>Physical characteristic</h3>

                <p class="altalanos">Head to hindquarters, raccoons measure between 40 and 70 cm (16 and 28 in), not
                    including the bushy tail
                    which can measure between 20 and 40 cm (7.9 and 15.7 in), but is usually not much longer than 25 cm
                    (9.8
                    in). The shoulder height is between 23 and 30 cm (9.1 and 11.8 in). The body weight of
                    an adult raccoon varies considerably with habitat, making the raccoon one of the most variably sized
                    mammals. It can range from 2 to 26 kg (4.4 to 57.3 lb), but is usually between 5 and 12 kg (11 and
                    26
                    lb). The smallest specimens live in southern Florida, while those near the northern limits of the
                    raccoon's range tend to be the largest (see Bergmann's rule). Males are usually 15 to 20% heavier
                    than females. At the beginning of winter, a raccoon can weigh twice as much as in spring because of
                    fat storage. The largest recorded wild raccoon weighed 28.4 kg (63 lb) and measured 140 cm
                    (55 in) in total length, by far the largest size recorded for a procyonid.

                    The most characteristic physical feature of the raccoon is the area of black fur around the eyes,
                    which
                    contrasts sharply with the surrounding white face coloring. This is reminiscent of a "bandit's mask"
                    and
                    has thus enhanced the animal's reputation for mischief. The slightly rounded ears are also
                    bordered by white fur. Raccoons are assumed to recognize the facial expression and posture of other
                    members of their species more quickly because of the conspicuous facial coloration and the
                    alternating
                    light and dark rings on the tail. The dark mask may also reduce glare and thus enhance night
                    vision. On other parts of the body, the long and stiff guard hairs, which shed moisture, are
                    usually colored in shades of gray and, to a lesser extent, brown. Raccoons with a very dark coat are
                    more common in the German population because individuals with such coloring were among those
                    initially
                    released to the wild. The dense underfur, which accounts for almost 90% of the coat, insulates
                    against cold weather and is composed of 2 to 3 cm (0.79 to 1.18 in) long hairs.</p>

                <h3>Intelligence</h3>
                <!--a 7 alpont megvalositasa lathato ezen a p paragrafuson-->
                <p class="paragrafus">Zoologist Clinton Hart Merriam described raccoons as "clever beasts", and that "in
                    certain directions
                    their cunning surpasses that of the fox". The animal's intelligence gave rise to the epithet "sly
                    coon". Only a few studies have been undertaken to determine the mental abilities of raccoons, most
                    of them based on the animal's sense of touch. In a study by the ethologist H. B. Davis in 1908,
                    raccoons
                    were able to open 11 of 13 complex locks in fewer than 10 tries and had no problems repeating the
                    action
                    when the locks were rearranged or turned upside down. Davis concluded that they understood the
                    abstract
                    principles of the locking mechanisms and their learning speed was equivalent to that of rhesus
                    macaques.

                    Studies in 1963, 1973, 1975 and 1992 concentrated on raccoon memory showed that they can remember
                    the
                    solutions to tasks for at least three years. In a study by B. Pohl in 1992, raccoons were able to
                    instantly differentiate between identical and different symbols three years after the short initial
                    learning phase. Stanislas Dehaene reports in his book The Number Sense that raccoons can
                    distinguish boxes containing two or four grapes from those containing three. In research by Suzana
                    Herculano-Houzel and other neuroscientists, raccoons have been found to be comparable to primates in
                    density of neurons in the cerebral cortex, which they have proposed to be a neuroanatomical
                    indicator of
                    intelligence.</p>
