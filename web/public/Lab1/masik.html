                <li>Fleas can jump 350 times its body length.</li>
                <li>Hummingbirds are the only birds that can fly backwards.</li>
                <li>Crocodiles cannot stick their tongue out.</li>
                <li> Starfish do not have a brain.</li>
                <li>Slugs have 4 noses.</li>
                <li>Only female mosquitoes bite.</li>
                <li>Polar bear skin is black!</li>
                <li>The only mammal capable of flight is the bat.</li>
                <li>A newborn kangaroo is the size of a lima bean.</li>
                <li>Otters “hold hands” while sleeping, so they don't float away from each other.</li>
                <li>The horned lizard is able to shoot blood from its own eyes, up to a distance of 3 feet away. The
                    rather bizarre and disgusting act is a defensive mechanism to confuse predators.
                    Their blood contains a chemical that is noxious to predators, and this isn't its only trick -
                    short-horned lizards are also capable of inflating their bodies up to twice their size to scare
                    anything away</li>

        <p>Otters are carnivorous mammals in the subfamily Lutrinae. The 13 extant otter species are all semiaquatic,
            aquatic, or marine, with diets based on fish and invertebrates. Lutrinae is a branch of the Mustelidae
            family,
            which also includes weasels, badgers, mink, and wolverines, among other animals.

            ummingbirds are birds native to the Americas and comprise the biological family Trochilidae.
            With approximately 366 species and 113 genera, they occur from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, but
            most species are found in Central and South America. As of 2024, 21 hummingbird species are listed
            as endangered or critically endangered, with numerous species declining in population.

            The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a large bear native to the Arctic and nearby areas.
            It is closely related to the brown bear, and the two species can interbreed. The polar bear
            is the largest extant species of bear and land carnivore, with adult males weighing 300-800 kg (660-1,760
            lb).
            The species is sexually dimorphic, as adult females are much smaller. The polar bear is white- or
            yellowish-furred
            with black skin and a thick layer of fat. It is more slender than the brown bear, with a narrower skull,
            longer
            neck and lower shoulder hump. Its teeth are sharper and more adapted to cutting meat. The paws are large and
            allow
            the bear to walk on ice and paddle in the water.
